# HTML5 crossword puzzle reader

Modified version of the [CrosswordNexus HTML5 Crossword Solver](https://github.com/crosswordnexus/html5-crossword-solver) to look/function more like the [NYT Crosswords](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords) site & [Downforacross](https://github.com/downforacross/downforacross.com).

Runs locally in your browser â€“ no files are sent to the server. Supports PUZ, JPZ, XML, CFP, and iPUZ formats.

### Bugs

 - "Check" function will not mark a square incorrect if its answer is a rebus
 - Word highlighting malfunctions in (very rarely-used) unchecked/unnumbered 1x1 squares
